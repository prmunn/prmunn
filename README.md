The Genomics Innovation Hub at Cornell was established by the Provostâ€™s Genome Biology Task Force to enable the development and application of cutting-edge genomics technologies. The GI Hub operates under a collaborative model with centralized resources and expertise. Researchers who collaborate with the GI Hub cover only the incremental cost of their research experiments.
